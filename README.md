# Fraud-Detection-on-Credit-Card-Transactions
For this project, I use Python with the customer’s transaction history as the data set and ingest it into decision trees, artificial neural networks, and logistic regression. As we feed more data to the system, we should be able to increase its overall accuracy.

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
